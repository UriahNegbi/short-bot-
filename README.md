# short-bot-for 1280x1080
this is abot that i created this is free source 
Everything that happens from this bot is at your own risk once you activate it only you are in control
Or you download it and change the code in it and all you do with it is just messing around. I don't support the creation of bots that violate certain laws. It's simply a good way to learn, but to use several libraries at the same time, don't misuse it. It can simply help you understand how to build an application.

you have the APP.js this is gona help you learn how to costemize your app to alot of screens in many sizes 
and the yutyob bot can comments on shorts (do not harm pepole with this its on your risk)
hope you learn somthing new
